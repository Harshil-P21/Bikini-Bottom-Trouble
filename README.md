# Bikini-Bottom-Trouble
Python game where you play as Patrick from Spongebob and try to stay alive as long as you can as asteroids fall from the sky. It's a very easy game. This is not meant to be anything super serious just a little coding project. 

You get 5 bubbles Patrick can blow upwards to detroy an asteroid. Use Left and Right arrow keys to move and Spacebar to shoot your bubbles.
